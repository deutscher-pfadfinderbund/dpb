# Django 1.8 Skeleton

This is a Django Skeleton to start a new Project nearly from scratch.

It contains the polls app from the official Django tutorial and I created a simple Bootstrap Theme.

Featuring:
* Django 1.8.2
* User registration and authentication in the frontend
* Bootstrap 3.3.4
* Bootstrap Theme *Slate*
* Fontawesome Icons 4.3.0

Clone / Fork it and have fun :-)
